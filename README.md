SLEEP TRACKER

This small program has been written in JavaScript in order to calculate the amount of hours that an individual sleeps in a week, it also determines if the individual should have gotten more sleep or if they overslept more than their ideal sleep amount.
The sleep times were calculated by using:
Arrow functions
if/else statements

The way it works is by first, the user needs to add what the total amount of sleep hours they desire each day and then they would need to add the total amount of sleep hours that they got each day. Once it reaches the end of the week the program will then calculate the total amount of sleep hours versus their ideal sleeps hours and will show the user the results.

Eventually I would want to incorporate the amount of cardio done in one week as well as in month and compare it with the ideal amount.
